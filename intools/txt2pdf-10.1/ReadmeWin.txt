What is txt2pdf?
================

txt2pdf is a very flexible Perl5 program. It allows you to convert all
your .TXT files to PDF format, and is flexible enough to run on any
platform that supports Perl.

Why do I need txt2pdf? 
======================

Most of your documents are text files.  Usually, your reports from
legacy applications, DBs, ERP applications and datawarehouse are
textual.  txt2pdf allows you to take those old text files and turn them
into PDF's using only PERL, which means you don't even need to pass the
data through PostScript first.

You can run txt2pdf on any system that runs PERL, but it has been tested
and is verified to work on many operating systems.  For more information
on tested operating systems, see
http://www.sanface.com/txt2pdftesters.html

Here are some of the things that you can achieve with txt2pdf:

o  You can mark coloured (using PERL regular expressions) phrases in 
   the produced PDF files.

o  You can mark bold, italic and bold italic phrases in the produced PDF
   files.

o  You can add page numbers on every page.

o  You can add text at the beginning and at the end of every file.

o  You can add a border to every page.

o  Internet specific phrases such as http://... ftp://... mailto:...
   file:... ldap:... news:...  will automatically be made into
   clickable URL's.

o  You can create a link to a specific age within a PDF document by
   simply adding http://...pdfdocument#pdfmark

o  Every word like MIME:... will automatically become a link that will
   launch the correct application to open that file.

o  You can use background and foreground layers.

o  All predefined encodings (WinAnsiEncoding, MacRomanEncoding,
   MacExpertEncoding, PDFDocEncoding) supported by the PDF format and
   the Unix default are supported by txt2pdf.
