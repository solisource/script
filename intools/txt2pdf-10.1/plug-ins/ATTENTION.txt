 If you are using the source code version, please be aware of thefollowing:
  o  In order to use txt2pdf.pl you will need to install the Zlib module
     and the Zlib libraries.
  o  If you plan to use txt2pdf-mail.pl then you also need to install the
     MIME::Lite modules.  If your SMTP gateway is on a different computer
     then you will also need to install LIBnet.
  o  You can find links to the modules in the Modules directory or from   CPAN.
  o  If you don't want or need to use compression, then you can simply use
     txt2pdf-no_zlib.pl
  o  Note that in this new version, the -c option has been replaced with
     -conf.  This is because there are two similiar options that -c might
     be confused with.  (-configure and -compress)
