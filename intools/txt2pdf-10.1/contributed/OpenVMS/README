TXT2PDF.COM is a short DCL procedure to interface with the script
(replacement for #!/usr/bin/perl in Unix) :

	Actually, the safest TXT2PDF.COM would be like this

$ INSTALL_DIR   = F$PARSE(F$ENVIRONMENT("PROCEDURE"),,,,"NO_CONCEAL")-"]["
$ INSTALL_DIR   =F$EXTRACT(0,F$LOCATE("]",INSTALL_DIR)+1,INSTALL_DIR)-".000000"
$ perl 'INSTALL_DIR'TXT2PDF.; 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !

	Safest because : usage of NO_CONCEAL and -"][" prevents from 
screw up in case of multiply chained VMS logicals definitions. Usage of 
-".000000" is added to support installation in perl_root:[000000] a very 
common directory for perl script installation. The ultimate would be to 
use the wrapper I have previously sent (but that would require a make 
file which appends to an OS-dependant wrapper the perl script.)

        The POD documentation is really the best for distributing a
        perl-based help. 

        pod2man txt2pdf.pod >txt2pdf.man
        pod2html txt2pdf.pod >txt2pdf.html
        pod2hlp txt2pdf.pod 

	The last command can be be used only if the POD2HLP.PM from Dan 
Susgalski is installed (on the Perl module archive). pod2man usually 

comes with perl distribution, perl2html has been added in recent versions 
of perl.

	User may include the generated TXT2PDF.HLP in the Help library
(either LIBRARY/REPLACE SYS$HELP:HELPLIB.HLB TXT2PDF.HLP 
or any suitable library for "freeware").

Multiuser Features 

A system manager can install txt2pdf and provide a default .cfg file for his
users/organization

define/system TXT2PDF wherever:default.cfg       VMS in SYLOGIN.COM for example

A user can still overwrite the value using another setenv or define command in
his own .cshrc/login.com if he wants to have a default file of his own.
A user can still have a working directory with a txt2pdf.cfg file and have it
loaded if exists. This allows him (without command line option) to setup fully
functional working directories.
He can also (as he wishes) use the -configure option to overwrite any defaults.
