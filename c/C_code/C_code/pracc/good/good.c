 * guess -- a simple guessing game                      *
 *                                                      *
 * Usage:                                               *
 *      guess                                           *
 *                                                      *
 *      A random number is chosen between 1 and 100.    *
 *      The player is given a set of bounds and         *
 *      must choose a number between them.              *
 *      If the player chooses the correct number he wins*
 *      Otherwise the bounds are adjusted to reflect    *
 *      the player's guess and the game continues.      *
 *                                                      *
 *                                                      *
 * Restrictions:                                        *
 *      The random number is generated by the statement *
 *      rand() % 100.  Because rand() returns a number  *
 *      0 <= rand() <= maxint  this slightly favors     *
 *      the lower numbers.                              *
