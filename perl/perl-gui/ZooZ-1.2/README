NAME
    ZooZ.pl - A Perl/Tk GUI builder in pure Perl/Tk.

SYNOPSIS
        % perl ZooZ.pl

DESCRIPTION
    ZooZ is a GUI builder for Perl/Tk written in pure Perl/Tk. It has the
    following features:

    *   Intuitive interface.

    *   Support for a wide variety of widgets.

    *   Ability to save/load projects.

    *   Ability to dump stand-alone Perl code.

    *   Ability to dump code as a Perl module in the form of a Perl/Tk mega
        widget.

    *   Includes a simple IDE for defining variables and subroutines.

STATUS AND LIMITATIONS
    ZooZ is an on-going effort, and will probably stay so for a long time.
    At this stage, though, I consider it to be very usable. There are some
    major limitations though. For a comprehensive list of missing features,
    you can look at the Progress.txt file that comes in the root directory
    of the distribution. If you think there is something else that should be
    included in that file, then drop me a note.

REQUIREMENTS
    To run ZooZ, you need Tk804, which in turn needs Perl 5.8 or better. I
    will probably support Tk800 sometime in the future, in which case any
    Perl5 version will be supported.

    In addition Tk::ToolBar is required. Again, I will probably make this
    optional in a future release.

OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
    Tk::CodeText is optional. If present it will be used in the simple IDE
    to highlight user-entered Perl code. If missing, a regular Tk::Text will
    be used.

TIPS
    *   You can create a project, then save the code as a Perl Module with a
        .pm extension. This will create a composite mega widget, with the
        same name as your project, but with any non-alphanumeric characters
        switched to underscores. For example, "Project 1.5" will be changed
        to "Project_1_5". You can then use this in a larger program as a
        regular widget.

        For example, if you dumped your module into myMod.pm, and your
        project was called "Project 1.5", then you would do this in your
        main code:

            use myMod;
            my $project = $parent->Project_1_5->pack;

        Note also that the mega widget will Advertise() every widget in your
        project. So, if your project had a canvas called Canvas1, you can
        access it like this:

            my $cv = $project->Subwidget('Canvas1');

    *   ZooZ automatically defines a hash called *%ZWIDGETS* that holds the
        project's widgets. This allows the user to access any widget inside
        of a callback via *$ZWIDGETS{WidgetName}* where WidgetName is the
        name of the widget.

    *   You can click on the row and column numbers to configure their
        properties.

    *   If you want a row or column to take up more space than it currently
        does, then increase its greediness. Remember that widgets are
        confined to the space of the grids they occupy.

BUGS
