OPTIONS
       -c --stdout
              Compress or decompress to standard output.
       -d --decompress
              Force  decompression.  bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat are
              really the same program,  and  the  decision  about
              what  actions to take is done on the basis of which
              name is used.  This flag overrides that  mechanism,
              and forces bzip2 to decompress.
       -z --compress
              The   complement   to   -d:   forces   compression,
              regardless of the invocation name.
       -t --test
              Check integrity of the specified file(s), but don't
              decompress  them.   This  really  performs  a trial
              decompression and throws away the result.
       -f --force
              Force overwrite of output files.   Normally,  bzip2
              will  not  overwrite  existing  output files.  Also
              forces bzip2 to break hard links to files, which it
              otherwise wouldn't do.

              bzip2  normally  declines to decompress files which
              don't have the  correct  magic  header  bytes.   If
              forced  (-f),  however,  it  will  pass  such files
              through unmodified.  This is how GNU gzip  behaves.
       -k --keep //keep source file (YES or NO)
              Keep  (don't delete) input files during compression
              or decompression.
       -s --small
              Reduce memory usage, for compression, decompression
              and  testing.   Files  are  decompressed and tested
              using a modified algorithm which only requires  2.5
              bytes  per  block byte.  This means any file can be
              decompressed in 2300k of memory,  albeit  at  about
              half the normal speed.

              During  compression,  -s  selects  a  block size of
              200k, which limits memory use to  around  the  same
              figure,  at  the expense of your compression ratio.
              In short, if your  machine  is  low  on  memory  (8
              megabytes  or  less),  use  -s for everything.  See
              MEMORY MANAGEMENT below.
       -q --quiet
              Suppress non-essential warning messages.   Messages
              pertaining  to I/O errors and other critical events
              will not be suppressed.
       -v --verbose
              Verbose mode -- show the compression ratio for each
              file  processed.   Further  -v's  increase the ver-
              bosity level, spewing out lots of information which
              is primarily of interest for diagnostic purposes.
       -L --license -V --version
              Display  the  software  version,  license terms and
              conditions.
       -1 (or --fast) to -9 (or --best)
              Set the block size to 100 k, 200 k ..  900  k  when
              compressing.   Has  no  effect  when decompressing.
              See MEMORY MANAGEMENT below.  The --fast and --best
              aliases  are  primarily for GNU gzip compatibility.
              In particular, --fast doesn't make things  signifi-
              cantly  faster.   And  --best  merely  selects  the
              default behaviour.

1,exam: for compress(bzip2 "-z" option don`t a must option)
tar cvf rpt.tar ./rpt 

bzip2     rpt.tar    --->rpt.tar.bz2(delete source file) 
bzip2 -k  rpt.tar    --->rpt.tar.bz2(don't delete source file) 
bzip2 -kv rpt.tar    --->rpt.tar.bz2(don't delete source file,view detail information) 
bzip2 -kv -9 rpt.tar --->rpt.tar.bz2(don't delete source file,tar,view detail information,for best) 


2,exam: for uncompress(bunzip2 "-d" option don`t a must option)
